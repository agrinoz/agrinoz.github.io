**Privacy Policy for Lino Flashcards**

Last updated: February 15, 2023



This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.
“Lino Flashcards” also is referred to as “we,” “us” or “our” in this Privacy Policy.

Privacy Principle

Lino Flashcards has been developed by parents for parents to provide safe, entertaining, and educational content. We take this seriously and recognize the importance of privacy concerns especially in the digital environment.
With this in mind, we have adopted this Privacy Policy for our Platforms. On our Platforms, we collect anonymous personal information that we automatically collect from your phone or other device.

Our Privacy Policy is based on the following principles:

1. You are not going to be asked to submit any personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number or other information that can be used to identify or contact an individual, whether online or offline. Our activities do not require you to submit any personal information.
2. We use the anonymous information that is automatically collected from your device, such as a computer’s Internet Protocol address, a mobile device identifier, operating system, or general location such as zip code, to support internal operations so that we can understand and monitor the usage of our Platforms and improve the performance of the Platforms.
3. We only use advertising that follows the Google Play Families Policies
4. Third parties that we use to assist with the app are required to follow this Privacy Policy. 

ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13

5. Our collection of personal information on our app that are directed to children under 13 is intended to follow the principles of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children under the age of 13.
6. We will obtain parental consent before asking for personal information unless the request for information falls within an exception that would be permitted under COPPA.
7. We do not make personal information collected from children publicly available nor do we enable children to so. We will not condition a child’s participation in any activity or service on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.
8. Parents may contact us (at info@agrinoz.com) to review, update or delete any of their children’s personal information that we may have collected and to elect for us not to collect any additional personal information from their children.
9. We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting the updated Privacy Policy online. We will not change how we handle previously collected information without providing notice and obtaining parental consent where necessary.

The following describes our Privacy Policy as it relates to certain specific activities.

INFORMATION WE REQUEST ON OUR CHILDREN’S PLATFORMS

We will obtain parental consent before asking for personal information unless the request for information falls within an exception that would be permitted under COPPA. We will explain how we will use the information and use it only for that purpose. 

INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY

We use the anonymous information that is automatically collected to support the internal operations of the app. Some of this information is collected through third-party analytics tools. Internal operations include the following:
 to monitor metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic.
to understand which activities and services are most popular.
to understand the pages where visitors viewed.
to reduce the repetition in the promotional messages that users see on our app.
to understand generally the location of our users (e.g., zip code information).
to diagnose and fix technology problems.
When you visit the app, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels and web beacons, to collect this anonymous information for the purpose of the internal operations of the app. A “cookie” is a piece of information that a web site or an app transfer to a user’s device for record-keeping purposes. As a user moves from one page or one screen to another, a cookie is used to tell us that it is the same device. We also may use a cookie to keep track of your selections. You may set your device to accept or not accept cookies and you may delete any cookies that you have received. However, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your device, you may not be able to use certain services or features. A “web beacon” is a one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded on a web page or e-mail message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page or e-mail message.

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

Law Enforcement and Safety. We may access, preserve and share your information when we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to: (i) respond to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) or otherwise to take action because we believe it is required or advisable under the law; (ii) detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; (iii) respond to your requests for customer service; or (iv) limit our legal liability or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ourselves, any user of our Platforms, a third party or the general public including as part of investigations.

Business Transfer. If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Lino Flashcards or our assets to another organization (e.g., during a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your personal information, and any other information collected through the app may be among the items sold or transferred. The buyer or transferee will be required to honour the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

Security Notice. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavour to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent you have given us your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.

SERVICE PROVIDERS

We contract with third parties to provide certain services to facilitate the operations of our app (“service providers”), such as to manage the analytics information about usage of our Platforms or to process donations. Our service providers will be given access to your information only as is reasonably necessary to provide the services for which they are contracted. They will be required to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy in their handling of personal information.

WHERE WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION

The app is governed by and operated in, and in accordance with the laws of, the United States, and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of the United States.  Your information collected through a Platform may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities. We or our service providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We strive to maintain the security of information but cannot guarantee that information security measures are fail-safe or guarantee that information on the app may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Our app maintains technical and organizational steps to keep information collected secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers and use of electronic security systems and password protections to guard against unauthorized access.

ONLINE SAFETY

Involvement in your family’s online lives is one of the most important safety tools available. In addition, we encourage you to educate yourself and your child on privacy concerns. We recommend, as a starting point, the following guide published by the federal government, https://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-kids-privacy.
